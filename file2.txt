An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons (a simplified version of biological neurons in an animal brain). Each connection (a simplified version of a synapse) between artificial neurons can transmit a signal from one to another. The artificial neuron that receives the signal can process it and then signal artificial neurons connected to it.
